1. Let's assume that A completes the work in 'a' days. According to the given information, A does 4/5th of the work in 3/5th of the time compared to B. This means that the ratio of their work rates is 4/5 : 1 and the ratio of their time taken is 3/5 : 1.

Since the work done is directly proportional to time and inversely proportional to the number of days, we can set up the equation:

(A's work rate) * (A's time) = (B's work rate) * (B's time)

(4/5) * (3/5) * a = 1 * 1 * 12

Simplifying the equation:

12a = 25
a = 25/12

Therefore, A alone will complete the work in approximately 2.08 days.

2. Let's assume that the work can be completed by 1 man in 'x' hours, 1 woman in 'y' hours, and 1 child in 'z' hours.

From the given information, we can set up three equations:

1/x + 3/y + 4/z = 1/96
2/x + 8/z = 1/80
2/x + 3/y = 1/120

Solving these equations, we can find the values of x, y, and z. Then, we can find the time in which the work can be completed by 10 men and 5 women using the equation:

1/(10x) + 5/y

3. Let's assume the original sales of cinema tickets are 100 units and the original price of a ticket is 1 unit.

After the increase in sales by 57 1/7%, the new sales become 100 + (57 1/7% of 100) = 157 1/7 units.

After the increase in ticket price by 16 2/3%, the new ticket price becomes 1 + (16 2/3% of 1) = 1 2/3 units.

The revenue collection can be calculated by multiplying the sales by the ticket price:

Original revenue = 100 units * 1 unit = 100 units
New revenue = 157 1/7 units * 1 2/3 units = (157 + 1/7) * (5/3) units

The percentage increase in revenue collection can be calculated as:

Increase in revenue = New revenue - Original revenue
Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Original revenue) * 100

4. The total food available initially is sufficient for 1600 soldiers for 60 days. Each soldier consumes 900 grams of food per day.

Total food available = 1600 soldiers * 900 grams/day * 60 days = 86,400,000 grams

After 40 days, 400 soldiers left the camp. So, the remaining number of soldiers is 1600 - 400 = 1200 soldiers.

The remaining soldiers consume 1000 grams of food per day. Let's assume the number of days the remaining food will last for the remaining soldiers is 'd'.

Total food consumed by remaining soldiers = 1200 soldiers * 1000 grams/day * d days = 1,200,000d grams

Since the total food available equals the total food consumed, we can set up the equation:

86,400,000 grams = 1,200,000d grams

Solving for 'd', we get:

d = 86,400,000 grams / 1,200,000 grams
d = 72 days

Therefore, the remaining food will last

 for the remaining soldiers for approximately 72 days.

5. Let's assume the cost price of the bicycle is 'x' rupees.

According to the given information, the dealer sold the bicycle at a profit of 10%. This means the selling price is 110% of the cost price:

Selling price = 1.10x

If the dealer had bought the bicycle at 10% less price and sold it for Rs. 60 more, he would have gained 25%. This means the selling price would be 125% of the cost price plus Rs. 60:

Selling price = (1.25x - 0.10x) + Rs. 60
Selling price = 1.15x + Rs. 60

Since the selling price remains the same, we can equate the two expressions:

1.10x = 1.15x + 60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.05x = 60
x = 60 / 0.05
x = 1200

Therefore, the cost price of the bicycle is Rs. 1200.
